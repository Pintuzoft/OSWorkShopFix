# OSWorkShopFix

Simple perl script to automate workshop maps for CS2

Use with Linux Game Server Manager (LGSM) found here:

https://linuxgsm.com/servers/cs2server/


Install

Run the LGSM as its own user, I tend to use cs2 user so the script is by default
having '/home/cs2' as its base directory, and where it has the cs2server command.

Just unarchive this into your /home/cs2 folder
